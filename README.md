# About Me -
I am an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems and real-time electronics. I enjoy building and experimenting with hardware-based systems where theoretical concepts are translated into practical, working solutions.

I have a problem-solving mindset and focus on understanding how embedded systems behave in real-world conditions. I believe in learning through hands-on experimentation, testing, debugging, and continuous improvement at both hardware and firmware levels.

I am currently seeking an entry-level opportunity in the electronics or embedded domain, where I can learn from industry professionals, contribute effectively, and grow as an engineer.
